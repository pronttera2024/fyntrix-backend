    "answer": "RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a momentum oscillator that ranges from 0–100 and compares recent gains vs losses. In practice, readings above ~70 often signal overbought strength that can cool off, while below ~30 suggests oversold weakness that may stabilise. I don’t use RSI alone – I combine it with trend, support/resistance and volume before taking a stance.",

    "answer": "Intraday trades are opened and closed the same day, focusing on short, high-liquidity moves and tighter risk control. Swing trades usually hold for a few days to weeks, riding broader moves between support and resistance. I’ll suggest more selective, slower ideas if you prefer swing, and faster, tighter setups if you set your profile to Intraday/Scalping.",
